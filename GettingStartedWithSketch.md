# Getting Started with Sketch

##Overview

The [Sketch App](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) by Bohemian Coding is a professional vector graphics app with a beautiful interface and powerful tools. 

As any newborn, it will take some time to get to a maturity level that we all expect it to get as a professional design application.

One of the great advantages of Sketch, like [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), it has the ability to install open-source plugins writen by great people that advocates posting their code on GitHub. 


##The goal here is..
1. To get you started with Sketch by leading you to some quick tutorials, 
2. Most importantly, setup a quick workflow where you will be able to install plugins in Sketch by - simply - clicking on the **Clone in Desktop** button on Github.

I'm aiming this article to a designer that are not so familiar with GIT/GitHub shortcuts, hence 

##Quick Requirements
**Mac Only** - First off. Windows users, at this point, the [Sketch App](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)  is only available for Mac.

**Get a GitHub Account** - Other than having the Sketch app installed, you will need to have a [github account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.

**GitHub App for Mac** - Download the [GitHub app for Mac](http://mac.github.com/) and make sure you move it to your Applications folder. We will use it to create the plugin repository in your machine.

##Learning Sketch
I have have watched way too many tutorial videos about this app and - by far - here's [the most comprehensive walkthrough video](http://youtu.be/wIodpWdvqaU) about the Sketch app by JawnMercenary - quick and effective.

##Installing Plugins
###The conventional  way is:

1. to find the plugin folder for the Sketch app;
2. then copy the downloaded plugin folder into it.

This involves downloading a zip file, exploding this file, moving the folder to a hidden Library folder in your Mac - each time you need to install a plugin - which for some folks may be complicated.

###The quickest way:

1. Click on the "Clone in Desktop" button on GitHub - and voilÃ¡!

You will need get a few things setup once and you will be good to go anytime you need to install a new plugin in the future.


###Step 1 - Finding Sketch's Plugins folder

#####Go to Folder...
Open Finder, the navigate to `Go > Go to Folder...`

![Got to Folder](http://cl.ly/image/3z2L3q251h3w/Image%202014-02-12%20at%202.28.44%20PM.png)

#####Populate folder field
Enter the following path and hit the `Go` button

	~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch/Data/Library/Application Support/sketch/Plugins

#####Create new folder
Create a new folder - inside `Plugins` - called `My Sketch Plugins`, as follows:

![Create new folder](http://cl.ly/image/2D0r1b0t051t/Image%202014-02-12%20at%202.53.28%20PM.png)

#####Create a Favorites shortcut
Drag this new folder onto the Favorites section of your Sidebar. This will help you creating the repository in the GitHub app:

![Creating a shortcut](http://cl.ly/image/0G191W0b3w3P/dragToFavorites.gif)

####From this point on, I'm assuming that:

1. **You have already installed the GitHub app** 
2. AND have signed into your GitHub account under **Preferences** <kbd>Cmd + ,</kbd>

###Step 2 - Create a New Repository
Hit <kbd>Cmd + N</kbd> or go to `File > New Repository...` to create a **New Repository**

![Create New Repository](http://cl.ly/image/1N2o0W271R22/Image%202014-02-12%20at%202.05.19%20PM.png)

The following dialog will popup, add the `Name`, `Description` and choose the "**My Sketch Plugins**" folder from your favorite sidebar as your `Local Path`. Make sure to **check** the `Push to GitHub` option:

![Choose path](http://cl.ly/image/2n2E2R2D1t13/Image%202014-02-12%20at%203.28.57%20PM.png)

Then hit the `Create Repository` button. You should see an empty state screen for your new repository on GitHub.

If you go into your [GitHub](http://github.com) account you will see the new repository under the **Repositories** tab

![New repo on github.com](http://cl.ly/image/11402j0R053a/Image%202014-02-12%20at%203.37.10%20PM.png)

###Step 3 - Find some cool plugins
Since plugins for Sketch are writen in JavaScript, you will find plugins anywhere on the web, but most likely, the large majority will be on GitHub. One particular resource on GitHub is [bomberstudios](https://gist.github.com/bomberstudios). They have compiled a great list of Sketch plugins into the following Gist:

####[https://gist.github.com/bomberstudios/7694497](https://gist.github.com/bomberstudios/7694497)

Thanks to the folks at Bomber Studios!
 
###Step 4 - Cloning a plugin into your repository
#####Lorem Ipsum plugin
As a simple example, I will install the [Lorem Ipsum Plugin for Sketch](https://github.com/brandonbeecroft/Lorem-Ipsum-Plugin-for-Sketch) by [brandonbeecroft](https://github.com/brandonbeecroft)

#####Clone in Desktop button
Once in the plugin's main repository page, simply click on the `Clone in Desktop` button. 

This will **launch the GitHub Desktop** App, you may be alerted by your browser that the link is trying to launch your desktop application, you may accept it. 

#####Here comes the important step...

![Click on the Clone in Desktop button](http://cl.ly/image/142M042i2w2L/CloneInDesktop.png)

###Step 5 - Select your Favorite shortcut

The GitHub application will prompt you to select a location to place your cloned folder. 

#####Choose the "**My Sketch Plugins**" folder from your favorite sidebar

as follows then hit the `Clone` button.

##All done!
You should be good to go! To install more plugins, simply click on the `Clone in Desktop` and select your Favorite folder.
